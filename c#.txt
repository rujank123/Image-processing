1 .Define three variables:
A string named productName equal to TV.
An integer named productYear equal to 2012.
A float named productPrice equal to 279.99f.

2.Convert myDBL to int and print it.



JAVA:
1. Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:
If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

2. There are three lines of output:

On the first line, print String: followed by the unaltered String read from stdin.
On the second line, print Double: followed by the unaltered double read from stdin.
On the third line, print Int: followed by the unaltered integer read from stdin.
use nextLine()
Sample Input:
42
3.1415
Welcome to HackerRank's Java tutorials!
output:
String: Welcome to HackerRank's Java tutorials!
Double: 3.1415
Int: 42


3. Input Format
Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer. 
Each String will have a maximum of 1010 alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from 00 to 999999.
Output Format
In each line of output there should be two columns: 
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly 1515 characters. 
The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly 33 digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.
Sample Input
java 100
cpp 65
python 50
Sample Output
================================
java           100 
cpp            065 
python         050 
================================


python:
use single loop to iterate through the two provided
strings, and print all of their matching characters (i.e., the characters
that are at the same index and that are equal to each other), each on a separate line.
string1 = "aabbcsdw"
string2 = "abbbcsdd"
output:
a
b
b
c
s
d
